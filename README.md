# Learning Guide: Data Structures in C++
This repository provides guidelines and implementations of various data structures using C++. These implementations were created during my own learning process, and this guide will outline key concepts that are essential for learning data structures and what is not mandatory to learn but if you more practice you can.

let's divide topics 
## Linked List 
* [Singly Linkde List](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/01-%20Linked%20List/Singly%20Linked%20List) 
* [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/01-%20Linked%20List/Doubly%20Linked%20List) 

you can watch video from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwCMLs3sjOY4UQq4vXgGPwGLVX1Y5faaS) from video number 11 to 19 okay not 20 and 21 
if you need more practice solve some problem from [here](https://medium.com/javarevisited/15-leetcode-problems-to-get-better-at-linked-list-4c5aa8cd4a11)
you can leant too Circular linked list from [here](https://youtu.be/MXEIYJGB0nk?si=DjMcRvLmV5QWmhTt). 


## Stack 
* [Based Array](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/02-%20Stack/1-Based%20Array)
* [Based Linked List](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/02-%20Stack/2-%20Based%20Linked%20List)
* [Infix-Postfix-Prefix](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/02-%20Stack/4-%20Infix-Posfix-Prefix)
* [make Stack using two stacks](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/02-%20Stack/3-%20Using%20Two%20Stacks) this is not mandatory, just if you wanna more practice 

you can watch video from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwCMLs3sjOY4UQq4vXgGPwGLVX1Y5faaS) and watch video number 20 not for get okay.  
you can solve problems using stack on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/?page=1&topicSlugs=stack)

## Queue
* [Based Array](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/03-%20Queue/1-Based%20Array)
* [Based Linked List](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/03-%20Queue/2-%20Based%20Linked%20List)

you can watch video from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwCMLs3sjOY4UQq4vXgGPwGLVX1Y5faaS) and watch video number 21 not for get okay.  
you can solve problems using stack on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/?page=1&topicSlugs=stack)

## Binary Tree 
you can only show videos what is binary tree and types of binary tree from [here](https://youtu.be/abaxG_-P9Ug?si=z_Kit9TXymRUbarh) and Binary Tree Traversal from [here](https://youtu.be/tFsfKTTJD6I?si=FTcqxRhUIdYCH3JX) , if you more practice not see my code now after learning binary search tree you can see my code to understand clarity.

## Binary Search Tree  
* [BST](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/05-%20Binary%20Search%20Tree)

watch from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwCMLs3sjOY4UQq4vXgGPwGLVX1Y5faaS) from video number 24 to the end .  
to learn functions successor and predecessor [here](https://youtu.be/MikbKCPVsBY?si=Vo4c70aWCWSzJkKY) .

## AVL Tree 
* [AVL](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/06-%20AVL%20Tree)

watch this [here](https://youtu.be/br-1squJfkA?si=26IbU4HfRCe0EQN4) or any other video and see my code if you wanna .
then go watch these [videos](https://youtu.be/u3OVSkuOdqI?si=SuegE202aJv6Ig0A) from video number 82 to 89 

## Binary Heap 
* [Binary Heap](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/07-%20Binary%20Heap)

watch from [here](https://youtu.be/86mQ1gD3Zgg?si=j2qrPQcUBqWEbYzO) from 90 to 95 



## Trie
* [Trie](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/08-%20Letter%20Tree%20(Trie))

some interviews ask about implementation of Trie okay , you can watch this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEJXowNB4kPyi859E6qGUs7jlpQehJndl) to more understand and i suggest see my code 


https://youtu.be/Lrg6jm_a0zw?si=MivxCvgV_glvcmn8
## Hashing
* [Hash Table](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/09-%20Hash%20Table)
    * [Separate Chaining Collision Handling](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/09-%20Hash%20Table/1-%20Separate%20Chaining%20Collision%20Handling)
    * [Open Addressing](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/09-%20Hash%20Table/2-%20Open%20Addressing)

watch from [here](https://youtu.be/Lrg6jm_a0zw?si=DCwTuvVUBVeYNiR0) from 115 to end , my code is example from chat GPT to understadn more okay 


# Finaly 
you can watch from any video and playlist , I am here give you some guide and tips to make way be easy , if you get any suggest to edit my code please send me.

Best of luck godbay.
