# Learning Guide: Data Structures in C++
This repository provides guidelines and implementations of various data structures using C++. These implementations were created during my own learning process, and this guide will outline key concepts that are essential for learning data structures and what is not mandatory to learn but if you more practice you can.

let's divide topics 
## Linked List 
* [Singly Linkde List](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/01-%20Linked%20List/Singly%20Linked%20List) 
* [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/Mohamedgamal235/Data-Structure-C-plus-plus/tree/master/01-%20Linked%20List/Doubly%20Linked%20List) 

you can watch video from [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwCMLs3sjOY4UQq4vXgGPwGLVX1Y5faaS) from video number 11 to 19 okay not 20 and 21 

if you need more practice solve some problem from [here](https://medium.com/javarevisited/15-leetcode-problems-to-get-better-at-linked-list-4c5aa8cd4a11)
